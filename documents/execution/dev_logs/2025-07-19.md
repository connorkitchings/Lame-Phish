# Development Log - 2025-07-19

## Session Overview
**Duration:** ~2 hours  
**Focus:** Complete data acquisition pipeline for Goose Setlist Selector  
**Participants:** Connor Kitchings, AI Co-Pilot  

## Tasks Completed

### [TASK-03] - Create Data Fetching Script and Complete Data Pipeline
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Priority:** High  

**Description:**
Implemented comprehensive data fetching pipeline to acquire all historical Goose show, setlist, and song data from elgoose.net API for machine learning model training.

**Key Accomplishments:**
1. **API Discovery and Migration:**
   - Initially attempted elgoose.net API v2 based on documentation
   - Discovered v2 API incomplete (setlists only through 2022-05-01)
   - Successfully migrated to API v1 with complete dataset

2. **Data Pipeline Implementation:**
   - Created robust API client for elgoose.net v1 endpoints
   - Implemented client-side filtering for Goose artist data
   - Built validation and transformation scripts
   - Generated production-ready CSV files

3. **Complete Dataset Acquired:**
   - **Shows:** 773 Goose shows (2014-2025) with full coverage
   - **Setlists:** 6,635 setlist entries (2014-2025) including recent years
   - **Coverage:** Complete 2014-2025 span with recent data through June 2025

## Technical Decisions

### API Version Selection
**Decision:** Use elgoose.net API v1 instead of v2  
**Rationale:** v2 API missing 2023-2025 setlist data (4,000 vs 8,404 total records)  
**Impact:** Gained access to complete historical dataset required for accurate model training

### Filtering Strategy
**Decision:** Client-side filtering vs server-side API parameters  
**Rationale:** Server-side `artist=1` parameter appeared to limit results  
**Implementation:** Fetch all data, filter for `artist_id=1` in post-processing

### Data Storage Format
**Decision:** Both JSON and CSV outputs  
**Rationale:** JSON for raw data preservation, CSV for analysis and ML workflows  
**Files Generated:**
- `goose_shows.csv` (773 records × 22 columns)
- `goose_setlists.csv` (6,635 records × 38 columns)

## Code Artifacts

### Scripts Created
- `scripts/explore_v1_api.py` - API v1 endpoint discovery and testing
- `scripts/fetch_goose_v1.py` - Production data fetcher with validation

### Data Files Generated
- `data/v1_goose/goose_shows.json` - Raw show data
- `data/v1_goose/goose_setlists.json` - Raw setlist data  
- `data/final_v1/goose_shows.csv` - Clean show dataset
- `data/final_v1/goose_setlists.csv` - Clean setlist dataset

## Challenges Encountered

### API Documentation Mismatch
**Issue:** elgoose.net API docs focused on v2, but v1 had more complete data  
**Resolution:** Built API explorer to test multiple versions and endpoints  
**Learning:** Always validate API completeness beyond documentation

### Data Completeness Validation
**Issue:** Initial v2 results showed missing recent years (2023-2025)  
**Resolution:** Systematic comparison of API versions and unfiltered data fetching  
**Learning:** Client-side filtering often more reliable than server-side parameters

### Import Path Management
**Issue:** Multiple failed attempts to resolve Python import paths for local modules  
**Resolution:** Created self-contained scripts to avoid sys.path manipulation  
**Learning:** Self-contained scripts more maintainable than complex import hierarchies

## Data Quality Assessment

### Coverage Analysis
- **Temporal Coverage:** Complete 2014-2025 (11+ years)
- **Show Coverage:** 773 total Goose shows
- **Setlist Coverage:** 6,635 song performances across shows
- **Recent Data:** Confirmed through June 2025

### Data Validation Results
- **Shows:** ✅ Complete coverage all years 2014-2025
- **Setlists:** ✅ Complete coverage including recent years (2023: 1,004, 2024: 968, 2025: 492)
- **Songs:** ℹ️ Catalog endpoint is artist-agnostic (expected behavior)

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next Session)
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Analyze setlist patterns, song frequencies, venue trends
2. **Feature Engineering:** Create features for ML model (song transitions, venue history, seasonal patterns)
3. **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, create training/test splits

### Medium Term
1. **Model Development:** Implement baseline and advanced setlist prediction models
2. **Model Validation:** Cross-validation and performance metrics
3. **CLI Interface:** User-friendly prediction interface

### Long Term
1. **Model Deployment:** Production-ready prediction system
2. **Web Interface:** Optional Streamlit dashboard
3. **Continuous Updates:** Pipeline for new show data integration

## Session Handoff

### Current State
- ✅ Complete Goose dataset acquired and validated (2014-2025)
- ✅ Production CSV files ready for analysis
- ✅ Data pipeline documented and reproducible
- ✅ Sprint 1 objectives fully achieved

### Environment Setup
- Python 3.13.5 with uv package manager
- Dependencies: requests, pandas, scikit-learn, xgboost
- Project structure: src/, data/, scripts/, tests/, documents/

### Key Files for Next Session
- `data/final_v1/goose_shows.csv` - 773 shows for venue/date analysis
- `data/final_v1/goose_setlists.csv` - 6,635 setlist entries for ML training
- `scripts/fetch_goose_v1.py` - Reproducible data pipeline

## Lessons Learned

1. **API Version Testing Critical:** Don't assume latest version has most complete data
2. **Data Validation First:** Always verify data completeness before proceeding with analysis
3. **Self-Contained Scripts:** Avoid complex import hierarchies for data processing scripts
4. **Client-Side Filtering:** Often more reliable than server-side API parameters
5. **Incremental Validation:** Test each step of data pipeline independently

---

**Next Session Focus:** Feature engineering and exploratory data analysis of complete Goose dataset

**Estimated Time to ML Model:** 2-3 additional sessions (feature engineering, model development, validation)
